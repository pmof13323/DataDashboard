# DataDashboard
Welcome to my data science project where I'm developing a data dashboard using top music chart data from 2020.
Check out the dashboard at musicdash.streamlit.app

# Project Aims
As part of this project, I'm diving into Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand its fundamentals and apply these to analyse music trends.

# NLP Learning Goals
Get a grip on basic NLP concepts like text processing and tokenisation.
Conduct sentiment analysis on song names to see what emotions are most prevalent in popular music.
Try out text classification to group songs, potentially by genre or mood.
Find a relationship between popularity of songs and musical characteristics.
Learn and apply association rule mining and N-gram analysis techniques.

The project is built with Python, using Streamlit for the dashboard.
